About My Girlfriend
</p>
</h1>
<h2 style="color:white;">
Her name is Angelicka Lein Silvestre. She is very CARING, and LOVING, GIRLFRIEND for me. She is the PRETTIEST, WEIRDEST, and CRAZIEST PERSON I've ever know. She loves EATING, TRAVELLING, SHOPPING, and also BONDING with her FAMILY and WITH ME. WE HAVE PLANS IN THE FUTURE AND WE WILL EXECUTE IT IN THE RIGHT TIME. FOR NOW, WE WILL KEEP LOVING EACH OTHER AND KNOWING ONE ANOTHER TO BE READY FOR OUR FUTURE LIFE.
