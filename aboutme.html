I am Geoffrey p. gubatan, a very simple, god fearing, caring, talented, understanding, trustworthy and kind hearted human being. I believe in the motto ‘Live and let live’. I hate liars. I am fun loving, down to earth and very much Optimist. I love travelling, sight seeing, listening to any genre of music except for the weird ones, Watching movies, playing sports like basketball and table tennis, playing video games like Grand theft auto, call of duty and Defense of the ancients. i love also going to the mall especially when i have  money.

someday, I’ll have my own family with two wonderful kids and very responsible, caring, and loving wife that will keep my family together till the last breath of mine. I’ll have my great son and beautiful daughter that will care for me and my wife as we grow old in this wonderful world. I’ll have my own house that will keep my family away from trouble in their vulnerable life. I’ll have three cars, one is Toyota Alphard for my family, second is Ford Ranger for me, and third is Volkswagen Beetle for my wife.
